This module extends the standard Odoo Partner model (res.partner) by
adding a new page called "Characteristics" to the Partner form view.
This page contains several new character fields intended for storing
specific codes and identifiers related to the partner, such as time
codes, sector classifications, unit identifiers, and channel codes.

This provides a dedicated section on the partner record to manage these
specific details, keeping the main partner view cleaner while still
allowing essential business characteristics to be recorded.
